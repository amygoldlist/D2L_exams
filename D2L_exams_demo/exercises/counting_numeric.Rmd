### This is a basic Counting question

## pick a fun name
## This makes the test harder to google when students cheat.
school_names <- c("Margaret Lawrence", "Alice Munro", "Viola Desmond", "Laura Secord")
school <- sample(school_names, 1)

### generate a whack of numbers for the problem
k_1 <- sample(2:3,1)
k_2 <- sample(20:25,1)

j_1 <- sample(4:10,1)
j_tot <- j_1*sample(20:25,1)

i_1 <- sample(4:7,1)
i_2 <- sample(22:27,1)

s_1 <- sample(15:25,1)

tot <- k_1*k_2+j_tot+ i_1*i_2+s_1

## and find the answer
mean_kids <- round(tot/(k_1+j_1+i_1+1),2)


```


Question
========
At `r school` School, there are `r k_1` kindergarten classes with `r k_2` students in each.  There are `r j_1` junior classes, containing a total of `r j_tot` students.  There are `r i_1` intermediate classes containing an average of `r i_1` students per class.  There is one senior class containing `r s_1` students.  What is the mean class size at `r school` School?  *Round to two decimal places*

Solution
========
The mean number of students per class is `r mean_kids` students.
